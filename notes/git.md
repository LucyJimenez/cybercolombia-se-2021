# Git

# Preliminaries

- Need to have a proper command-line environment

- Linux, OS X with Homebrew, or Windows Subsystem for Linux 2

- Install `git` using package manager, if not already installed.

- Install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to get the `gh` command.

# Git vs. GitHub

- Git is a general version control tool that can be used with or without a hosting service.

- GitHub is used for hosting a repository remotely; can either be public or private.

- Being able to work effectively with GitHub requires knowing Git basics and being able to operate in both worlds.

# Set up SSH key

- We'll look at how to configure ssh.
- Recommend to set up an ssh key different from what you use for other servers
- You can go with or without passphrase - I won't tell.

# Clone repo for tutorial

# The Terminal shall set you free

Everything we do in this tutorial will take place at the terminal. You'll come to see the following:

- It's fun!
- It's easier to really learn the concepts without additional clutter/window dressing.
- You'll be able to work effectively for any language of interest (e.g. C/C++, Python, Java).
- Knowing the concepts will also help you, should you find yourself using a development environment or smart editor, e.g. VS Code

# git

Make sure git is in your path.

```
$ which git
```

# git config

You want to do this to have your info show correctly in the log.

```
git config --global user.name "Mickey Mouse"
git config --global user.email "mmouse@cybercolombia.org"
```

# Fork the CyberColombia repo

# Clone forked repo to your local filesystem.

# Add and commit a file to the repo

# Issue Pull Request

# Monitor GitHub (and e-mail) to see whether your pull request is accepted.

# Set up an upstream remote to pull changes from the main repository and stay in sync

# Ensure your own fork is in sync

# Continue absorbing changes from others

A key aspect of working in a distributed team is to pull in chnanges from others.

# Importance of notifications

- Integrations for many platformss
- Developers must communicate using a system like Slack, Google, etc.
- Email is ok for tracking less frequent changes.

# Issue Tracking

# Releases

# Discussions

# Wiki Pages

# Projects
